About

GPX, or GPS Exchange Format, is an XML schema designed as a common GPS data format for software applications.

It can be used to describe waypoints, tracks, and routes. The format is open and can be used without the need to pay license fees. Its tags store location, elevation, and time and can in this way be used to interchange data between GPS devices and software packages. Such computer programs allow users, for example, to view their tracks, project their tracks on satellite images or other maps, annotate maps, and tag photographs with the geolocation in the Exif metadata.

Files for the following regions are included:

* [Atlanta, Georgia](atlanta.gpx)
* [Rogue Valley, Oregon](rvtd.gpx)
* [San Diego, California](sandiego.gpx)
* [Seattle/Tacoma/Puget Sound, Washington](capitolhill.gpx)
* [Tampa Bay, Florida](tampa.gpx)
* [Washington, D.C.](washingtondc.gpx)
* [York Region Transit (Canada)](yorkca.gpx)

The following files are also included for test scenarios:

* [Invalid location (0.0, 0.0)](invalid.gpx)
