# Testing OneBusAway Android

We provide early access to new versions of OneBusAway Android via Google Play's [beta & alpha testing](https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta) platform. This helps us get feedback on bug fixes and new features before they are distributed to all users.

Please note that these versions are not as heavily tested as production releases and, as a result, may not be as stable.

## Register as a beta tester

1. Go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot and opt in for testing
1. Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot) (using the same Google account) - you'll now have access to the beta version!

Please be patient - it may take a few hours for the beta version to become available after you opt in.  You only have to complete the above steps once. Unless you opt-out (using the same link in #1 above), you'll continue to receive new beta versions as they are released.

Please note that you need to use the same Google account for both steps above, or you won't get access to the beta.

Note that as a beta tester you'll automatically get production releases too.

## Register as an alpha tester

We also offer very early access to new OneBusAway releases in alpha versions. Please note that these early versions will likely still contain bugs and will not be as polished as beta or production releases. However, if you're willing to put up with these quirks, we'd love to get feedback on early designs and new features.

To register for alpha versions, the process is basically the same as the beta registration, but the first step involves signing up for a different community:

1. Join the [onebusaway-developers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onebusaway-developers) using a Google account
2. Go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot and opt in for testing (using the same Google account)
3. Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot) (using the same Google account) - you'll now have access to the alpha version!

You only have to complete the above steps once. Unless you opt-out (using the same link in #2 above), you'll continue to receive new alpha versions as they are released.

Please note that you need to use the same Google account for all three steps above, or you won't get access to the alpha.

Also note that in Google Play, you'll still see the "OneBusAway (Beta)" label, and the message that you're a beta tester, even if you're an alpha tester.  You can safely ignore this if you've followed the above steps.

Note that as an alpha tester you'll automatically get beta and production releases too.

## How to provide feedback

Please let us know if you experience problems with a beta or alpha, or would like to give general feedback (good and bad)!

If the app crashes, please submit a crash report when you are prompted, and add comments on what you were doing when it crashed.  This gives us the information we need to fix problems.
