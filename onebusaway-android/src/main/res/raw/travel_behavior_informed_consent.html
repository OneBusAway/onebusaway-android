	Researchers at the University of South Florida (USF) study many topics. To
	do this, we need the help of people who agree to take part in a research
	study. The person who is in charge of this research study is Dr. Sean Barbeau.
	This study is sponsored by the National Center for Transit Research.

<h2>
	Purpose of the Study
</h2>

	<a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a>
	The purpose of this study is to better understand the travel behavior of
	transit users, including where and when travelers choose different mode of
	transportation such as the bus, walking, biking, and a car. This data will
	be used to inform better multimodal planning and policy.
</p>
<h2>
	<strong>How do I participate?</strong>
</h2>
<p align="left">
	If you take part in this study, your travel behavior information will be
	automatically collected by the OneBusAway Android application. You will also
	be asked to participate in a few online surveys about how and when you
	travel places. Each survey will take about 10 minutes to complete, and you
	will be asked to complete approximately 4 surveys over a period of two years.
	You may also be prompted occasionally to provide brief information about your travels
	(e.g., "Did you ride the bus on your last trip?").
