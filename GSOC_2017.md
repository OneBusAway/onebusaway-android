what I've developed on the physical device, instead of using emulators. I wasn't able to acces my 
laptop from my android device because my network has wifi isolation enabled and I do not have the 
rights to change this.

July 14
- Finally was able to understand how the other test were implemented and implement a first test for 
the bike rental request/response using mock datafrom the file system.

requests/responses and to allow mocking the requests/responses.

control over the component.

with Amazon maps.
