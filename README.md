# OneBusAway for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android)

This is the official Android app for OneBusAway!

OneBusAway for Android provides:

1. Real-time arrival information for public transit
2. A browse-able map of nearby stops
3. A list of favorite bus stops
4. Reminders to notify you when your bus is arriving
5. The ability to search for nearby stops or routes

OneBusAway for Android automatically keeps track of your most used stops and routes, and allows you to put shortcuts on your phone's home screen for any stop or route you choose.

It's available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot).

## Testing

Get early access to new OneBusAway Android versions! See our [Testing Guide](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/master/TESTING.md) for details.

## Build Setup

We use [Gradle build flavors](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html#workBuildVariants) to enable a number of different build variants of OneBusAway Android.

We have two Gradle "platform" flavor dimensions:

* **google** = Normal Google Play release
* **amazon** = Amazon Fire Phone release

...and three Gradle "brand" flavor dimensions:

* **oba** = Original OneBusAway brand
* **agencyX** = A sample rebranded version of OneBusAway for a fictitious "Agency X"
* **agencyY** = A sample rebranded version of OneBusAway for a fictitious "Agency Y"

This results in a total of 2 * 3 = 6 core build variants.  Each of these core variants also has a debug/release build type - the end result is that you'll have 12 build variants to choose to build.

The below instructions assume you're going to be building for the **google** platform flavor and original **oba** brand by default (e.g., `obaGoogleDebug`), but
also mention how you would build/run the **amazon** flavor for the **oba** brand (e.g., `obaAmazonDebug`).  If you want more info about building the other brands, please see the [Rebranding OneBusAway Android page](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/master/REBRANDING.md).

### Prerequisites for both Android Studio and Gradle

1. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environmental variables to point to your JDK folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27`)
2. If you want to build the Amazon platform flavor, you need to have [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed.  Then, from the root directory of the project run `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=libs/amazon-maps-api-v2.aar -DpomFile=libs/amazon-maps-api-v2.pom` to install the Amazon Maps API v2 library.

### Building in Android Studio

1. Download and install the latest version of [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).
2. Run Android Studio (Windows users may need to `Run as administator` when installing Android SDK components).
3. At the welcome screen select `Import Project`, browse to the location of this repository and double-click it.
4. Open the Android SDK Manager (Tools->Android->SDK Manager) and under the currently used SDK version (see `compileSdkVersion` in [`onebusaway-android/build.gradle`](onebusaway-android/build.gradle)) add a checkmark next to `Google APIs` then select `Install n packages`. `n` may be 1 or more if other updates are available.
5. Connect a [debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/tools/device.html) Android device to your computer or setup an Android Virtual Device (Tools->Andorid->AVD Manager).
6. Open the "Build Variants" window (it appears as a vertical button on left side of workspace by default).
7. Chose **obaGoogleDebug** to select the Google Play version, or **obaAmazonDebug** to select the Fire Phone
6. Click the green play button (or Alt+Shift+F10) to build and run the project!

### Building from the command line using Gradle

1. Download and install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Make sure to install the Google APIs for your API level (e.g. 17), the Android SDK Build-tools version for your `buildToolsVersion` version, the Android Support Repository and the Google Repository.
2. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environmental variable to your Android SDK location.
3. To build and push the app to the device, run `gradlew installObaGoogleDebug` from the command line at the root of the project (or `gradlew installObaAmazonDebug` for Amazon build flavor)
4. To start the app, run `adb shell am start -n com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot/org.onebusaway.android.ui.HomeActivity` (alternately, you can manually start the app)

### Release builds

To build a release build, you need to create a `gradle.properties` file that points to a `secure.properties` file, and a `secure.properties` file that points to your keystore and alias. The `gradlew assembleGoogleRelease` command will prompt for your keystore passphrase (for Amazon Fire Phone version, use `gradlew assembleAmazonRelease`).

The `gradle.properties` file is located in the onebusaway-android directory and has the contents:
```
secure.properties=<full_path_to_secure_properties_file>
```

The `secure.properties` file (in the location specified in gradle.properties) has the contents:
```
key.store=<full_path_to_keystore_file>
key.alias=<key_alias_name>
```

Note that the paths in these files always use the Unix path separator `/`, even on Windows. If you use the Windows path separator `\` you will get the error `No value has been specified for property 'signingConfig.keyAlias'.`

## Deploying OneBusAway Android in Your City

There are two ways to deploy OneBusAway Android in your city:

1. **Join the OneBusAway [multi-region project](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Multi-Region)** - The easiest way to get started - simply set up your own OneBusAway server with your own transit data, and get added to the OneBusAway apps!  See [this page](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Multi-Region) for details.
2. **Deploy a rebranded version of OneBusAway Android as your own app on Google Play** - Requires a bit more maintenance, but it allows you to set up your own app on Google Play / Amazon App Store based on the OneBusAway Android source code. See [rebranding page](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/master/REBRANDING.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### When running the project, I get a NullPointerException in `BaseMapFragment`, related to `mMap`

You're most likely trying to run the `amazon` build variant on an Google Android device, or the `google` build flavor on an Amazon device.

Please be sure to select the correct build flavor for your device/emulator when running the project:

* In Android Studio, you'll see a "Build Variant" button on the very left side of the screen, collapsed in the dock.  Click on this, and select either `googleDebug` for Google devices, or `amazonDebug` for Amazon devices.
* From the command line, run `gradlew installGoogleDebug` for Google devices, or `gradlew installAmazonDebug` for Amazon devices.

See the documentation at the top of the readme for more information on building via Android Studio or the command line.

### When importing to Android Studio, I get an error "You are using an old, unsupported version of Gradle..."

If you're using Android Studio v0.4.2 or lower, when importing, please be sure to select the `settings.gradle` file in the root, **NOT** the project directory.
You will get the above error if you select the project directory / name of the project.

### I get build errors for the Android Support libraries or Google APIs

Open the Android SDK Manager and make sure the following are installed:
* Under Tools
	* Android SDK Tools
	* Android SDK Platform-tools
	* Android SDK Build-tools
* Under the currently used SDK version (see `compileSdkVersion` in [`onebusaway-android/build.gradle`](onebusaway-android/build.gradle))
	* SDK Platform
	* Google APIs
* Extras
	* Android Support Repository
	* Android Support Library
	* Google Play services
	* Google Repository

### Android Studio or Gradle can't find my Android SDK, or the API Levels that I have installed

Make sure that you're consistently using the same Android SDK throughout Android Studio and your environmental variables.
Android Studio comes bundled with an Android SDK, and can get confused if you're pointing to this SDK within Android Studio
but have your environmental variables pointed elsewhere. Click "File->Project Structure", and then under "Android SDK"
make sure you "Android SDK Location" is the correct location of your Android SDK.

Also, make sure you've set the `ANDROID_HOME` environmental variable to your Android SDK location and
the `JAVA_HOME` environmental variables to point to your JDK folder.
