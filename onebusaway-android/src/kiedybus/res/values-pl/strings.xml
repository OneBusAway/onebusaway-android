    KiedyBus - Polish localization

    With the placeholder system, only app_name needs to be overridden.
    All other Polish translations come from the main values-pl/strings.xml
    and will automatically use the KiedyBus app name via %1$s placeholders.
-->
<resources>
    <!-- The only required override - all branded strings use this automatically -->
    <string name="app_name">KiedyBus</string>

    <!-- See src/main/res/values-pl/strings.xml for base Polish translations -->
